# 🏡 Real Estate Price Predictor

This project aims to predict housing prices using various regression models. It involves exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning to build a robust prediction system for real estate listings.

## 📂 Project Overview

This notebook performs a step-by-step analysis and predictive modeling on a real estate dataset, likely containing features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and more.

Although the dataset file path is not explicitly provided in the notebook, the code suggests that extensive data processing and modeling are applied to a structured housing dataset.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of important features (price, area, etc.)
- Visualization of feature relationships using `matplotlib`

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and data type conversions
- Feature engineering through operations like `drop`, `replace`, and `astype`

### 🧮 Feature Scaling
- Standardized the data using `StandardScaler` for better model performance

### ✂️ Train-Test Split
- Splits the data to evaluate model generalization using `train_test_split`

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

This project evaluates multiple regression models:
- **Linear Regression** (used multiple times)
- **Decision Tree Regressor**

These models are trained and evaluated to compare their performance on the real estate price prediction task.

---

## 📈 Visualizations
The notebook uses:
- Line plots
- Histograms
- Scatter plots

to visually explore feature distributions and relationships.

## 🔗 Future Scope
- Add cross-validation and model evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE)
- Expand to other algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Create a web interface using Flask or Streamlit for live predictions
